# imperfect_SUDOKU_solver
 It's an algorithm I came up with, but it doesn't solve all problems.

When solving a Sudoku problem, I tried to solve it as much as possible without making any predictions.
Easy problems can be solved, but some very difficult problems cannot be solved.

Written in an html file that can be executed in the browser.

This is the screen when running it.

The red square is the currently selected cell, and the value can be set by pressing the 1 to 9 keys. 
The selected cell can be moved using the wasd keys.

The gray square inside each cell indicates the number that can be the answer to that cell.
It has the structure of 3x3 and represents 1 to 9 in order from top left to bottom right.

When you enter 3 as shown in the image, 3 is displayed in the space where it does not fit.

As you fill in the spaces, blue numbers will appear. If there is only one number that can be the answer to each cell, it is displayed as a blue number.

This is what it looks like when the problem is completely solved.
